* * *

In 2004 I became friends with an Ukrainian guy called Petro that I met completely randomly at a bar by the beach...I was on holidays and he was there with some friends having some drinks.

Anyway,we started talking with each other...our friendship started like that...he became a regular at my house where our families would get together.

In 2008 he called me and asked me if I wanted to go on a road trip...I said "SURE!"

He had in mind to go to the south of Spain and visit his brother(his brother was there in jail at the time,near Huelva...) and also to visit his father in Portugal (his father was a former diplomat of the Ukraine, years before, and where he retired he decided to move to Portugal and live there...)

And so we went...we visited his brother and then went to Portugal to visit his father...

When we were at his house he asked us a favor(he is old)... if we could empty boxes from one of the rooms,as he wanted to make it into a bedroom for guests...

We said "OK" and went to the room,excepting to see some old newspapers...

Instead we found about 58 boxes full of old documents and books from the time when he was a diplomat...

Some papers(documents) were in Russian... some were even from the USSR times.


![Screenshot of "ARB_DS_Eye"](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yangboz/laughing-nemesis/master/assets/images/ARB_DS_EYE.jpg)


Petro started reading/translating some of them and we realized that there was a lot of interesting,intriguing and even top-secert (at least at one time) documents!

So we ask his father if we could keep this boxes for ourselves...he agreed and...we have to rent a van to take everything back to home with us.

Week after week,in our house but mainly on the weekends,we went through all of the documents,translating them,cataloguing them by subject matter,or dates and places,etc...

As,due to work,we were apart quite offen,we also did a lot of work on line.

That's when we found THE BOOK...the book that lead to the videos I publised...(this one book that we has is undated and looks "modern",but we did find the cover -only the cover- for the same book but dating back to 1951!)

We called his father later that year and asked him about the book...and he filled in the missing information...he said that amongst high ranking political officals there had always been the rumor of alien contact,but nothing concrete...

He said that he had received the book years before from one of his life-long diplomat friends and had been updating the book until recently with information that friends of his sent him,or when they would get together to talk about "old times".

That information(regular updates)was sent to him by mail,phone or online.

He still gets regular updates that transmits to me.

![Screenshot of "ARB_DS_Eye"](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yangboz/laughing-nemesis/master/assets/images/ARB_DS_EYE.jpg)

The book has hundreds of side-notes on the pages(updates),small papers with related miscellaneous info attached to pages,photos stapled to them,etc...that is how we found out about relatively recent visits from aliens,their numbers,where it happened,etc...they had been updating the information they could get regularly.

BUT he also said that there were only a handful of people that were in the "know" back then(USSR days)...the leader of the communist party and a couple of advisers,5 or 6 SMERSH agents(maybe more,up to 12),the commander of the armed forces AND the commander of the 3 armed forces branches(army,air-force and navy) and maybe a couple of scientists...

He said that most likely there were more people in the know,specially in the militray,but he could't confirm that!(him and his friends did not recognize some of the names mentioned on the book)

People have asked me about some of the illustrations of certain Alien Races on the book...this because some of them were literally copied off movies and/or video games(or not).

Me and Petro asked ourselves the same thing,as we recognized some of them...and we did contact his father in order to get an answer.

He told us that over the years the people that were adding/updating/printing the book has been using alien images from the media when they did not have a real photo or drawing from the witnesses...

So sometimes they used images from movies and video games that better discribed the Alien Races in question...this according to the witnesses testmonies(description of their encounters).

However he did say something else...something extremely interesting.

He told us that amongst high-ranking diplomats there has been much "solid" discussion and debate about "a plan" involving centain media (from online to paper to hollywood to the video game industry)and centain security departments (specially from Japen,China,Canada,USA and Europe) in order to use the "right"(to them)images to describe the appearance of aliens...

All the media involved was (in the end...either directly or because they owned the "mother" companies)owned for no more than 5 people...and that this was a concerted effort in order to get people(human-kind)used to the appearance and presence of alians...amongst us!

He(Petro's father)also told us that some of the alien races images used in video games(and other media)were used in the book PRIOR to the release of the game and/or movies...

Him and some of his friends had knowledge that some of those security departments had actually created some of the images and then "released" to the proper channels...in order for those images to be known to the general public.

This,obviously,we could not confirm...except for one of images on the book...the aliens used in the movie "Independence day" were known before the making (not even close) of the movie...by at least 8 years!

Also,some of the photos on the ARB,had been tampered with...

![Screenshot of "ARB_DS_Eye"](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yangboz/laughing-nemesis/master/assets/images/ARB_DS_EYE.jpg)

And so,there you have it...the "story" behind the ALIEN RACES RUSSIAN SECERT BOOK!

At least some of it...

I hope you enjoy the book and all the revelations contained in it.

![Screenshot of "ARB_DS_Mark"](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yangboz/laughing-nemesis/master/assets/images/ARB_DS_Mark.jpg)

this book is dedicated to the memory of PETRO

![Screenshot of "ARB_DS_Mark"](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yangboz/laughing-nemesis/master/assets/images/ARB_DS_Mark.jpg)

The ARB book has been re-editd(information always being updated in all aspects,from new alien races to new reports and photos or illustrations) at least 12 times. That we know the first edition was printed in 1946 or early 1947.Then new editions were printed:1951(Ihave the cover,just the cover,of that one),1959,1968,1971,1980...all the way to (we believe)2011.

THE LOST COPY

In the 1980's a copy of (edition) of this book was found on a field in Buryatia (east Siberia).

Thay copy ended up in the hands of a KGB agent with friends in the media.

After the collapse of the USSR some of the information (and images) in the book were leaked (sold?).

Years later the information and some of the images started apprearing in TV series and video games.

"Mass effect" being the most well known...

(this information was handwritten on the book)

![Screenshot of "ARB_DS_Eye"](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yangboz/laughing-nemesis/master/assets/images/ARB_DS_EYE.jpg)

In 1924,near Yekaterinoslav,Ukraine (now Dnipropetrovsk) the 3 daughters of a certain Captain Andriychuk simply vanished.

![Screenshot of "LOCATION_Dnipropetrovsk"](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yangboz/laughing-nemesis/master/assets/images/LOCATION_Dnipropetrovsk.jpg) ![Screenshot of "LOCATION_Dnipropetrovsk_gray"](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yangboz/laughing-nemesis/master/assets/images/LOCATION_Dnipropetrovsk_gray.jpg)


![Screenshot of "Captain_Andriychuk"](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yangboz/laughing-nemesis/master/assets/images/Captain_Andriychuk.jpg) Captain Andriychuk was of Russian descent and very little is known about him,except that he travelled a lot.

A farmer that lived near Captain Andriychuk's house said that he saw the Captain's daughters walking towards the woods maybe 2 hours before sunrise.

Intrigued,he followed them at a distance.After walking for 30 minutes he described seeing "purple and red lights and mist" through the trees.

He got closer and saw the 3 girls entering what he called "a floating bright windmill-like plane"...he also reported seeing 5 creatures as small as the children but with a "much old face".

According to him the "windmill" then flew very slowly "into the stars" until he could not tell them apart.

![Screenshot of "ARB_DS_Eye"](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yangboz/laughing-nemesis/master/assets/images/ARB_DS_EYE.jpg)

According to the farmer,he ran to Captain Andriychuk's house to warn him about the event.

![Screenshot of "Suppose_farmer's_home"](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yangboz/laughing-nemesis/master/assets/images/Suppose_farmer's_home.jpg) This photo supposedlly shows the farmer's house.

Upon arriving he knocked on the door but nobody answered...

He then entered the house and found the Captain and his wife dead on their bed...their faces "were peaceful",as if they had died during their sleep.

All their animals(3 dogs,1 horse and 2 goats) were dead as well.

On the kitchen table there was a letter or note(not signed) with the handwriting that matched Sofiya, one of the daughters.

It said:

"We are going to the school in the moon,with our friends..."

ANUNAKENE(aka Anunnaki)

They resemble Humans but are higher (2.5 meters/8') and more muscular.

When they first visited Earth there were already other races established here...some malevolent and with supernatural powers.

The Anunakene defeated them and became the most powerful race on Earth.

They will return one day as promised by themselves,however the date of their return is still mystery.

They do know all that is happening on Earth as well as in other planets where they had influence (and/or still have).

The proximity of planet Nibirue (aka Nibiru) dose cause cosmic instability and weather-related repercussions in all planets of our solar system,but dose not cause the amount of destruction that it is usually accepted and believed.

How far they are it is still mystery.

AFIM

They come from constellation Lyra.

They call themselves "Afim Spiantsy" because of a war that they fought against a race called "Spiantsy"...the "Spiantsy" race had 12 times more members and 35 times more ships and resources than "Afim"...but the "Afim" won in the end...

So they added the "Spiantsy" name to their own race-name,as "warning" to other races...

They have colonized 10 planets in a non-violent way.

When they are close to Humans they can become invisible,but humans when around them will feel a certain amount of unexplained anxiety.

Their ships are small and spherical in shape.One of the reasons they visit us is to study what they call "Human Deviation",in order to determine the development of the Human race.
