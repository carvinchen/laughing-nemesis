In 2004 I became friends with an Ukrainian guy called Petro that I met completely randomly at a bar by the beach...I was on holidays and he was there with some friends having some drinks.

Anyway,we started talking with each other...our friendship started like that...he became a regular at my house where our families would get together.

In 2008 he called me and asked me if I wanted to go on a road trip...I said "SURE!"

He had in mind to go to the south of Spain and visit his brother(his brother was there in jail at the time,near Huelva...) and also to visit his father in Portugal (his father was a former diplomat of the Ukraine, years before, and where he retired he decided to move to Portugal and live there...)

And so we went...we visited his brother and then went to Portugal to visit his father...

When we were at his house he asked us a favor(he is old)...
