* * *

In 2004 I became friends with an Ukrainian guy called Petro that I met completely randomly at a bar by the beach...I was on holidays and he was there with some friends having some drinks.

Anyway,we started talking with each other...our friendship started like that...he became a regular at my house where our families would get together.

In 2008 he called me and asked me if I wanted to go on a road trip...I said "SURE!"

He had in mind to go to the south of Spain and visit his brother(his brother was there in jail at the time,near Huelva...) and also to visit his father in Portugal (his father was a former diplomat of the Ukraine, years before, and where he retired he decided to move to Portugal and live there...)

And so we went...we visited his brother and then went to Portugal to visit his father...

When we were at his house he asked us a favor(he is old)... if we could empty boxes from one of the rooms,as he wanted to make it into a bedroom for guests...

We said "OK" and went to the room,excepting to see some old newspapers...

Instead we found about 58 boxes full of old documents and books from the time when he was a diplomat...

Some papers(documents) were in Russian... some were even from the USSR times.

Petro started reading/translating some of them and we realized that there was a lot of interesting,intriguing and even top-secert (at least at one time) documents!

So we ask his father if we could keep this boxes for ourselves...he agreed and...we have to rent a van to take everything back to home with us.

Week after week,in our house but mainly on the weekends,we went through all of the documents,translating them,cataloguing them by subject matter,or dates and places,etc...

As,due to work,we were apart quite offen,we also did a lot of work on line.

That's when we found THE BOOK...the book that lead to the videos I publised...(this one book that we has is undated and looks "modern",but we did find the cover -only the cover- for the same book but dating back to 1951!)

We called his father later that year and asked him about the book...and he filled in the missing information...he said that amongst high ranking political officals there had always been the rumor of alien contact,but nothing concrete...

He said that he had received the book years before from one of his life-long diplomat friends and had been updating the book until recently with information that friends of his sent him,or when they would get together to talk about "old times".

That information(regular updates)was sent to him by mail,phone or online.

He still gets regular updates that transmits to me.

The book has hundreds of side-notes on the pages(updates),small papers with related miscellaneous info attached to pages,photos stapled to them,etc...that is how we found out about relatively recent visits from aliens,their numbers,where it happened,etc...they had been updating the information they could get regularly.

BUT he also said that there were only a handful of people that were in the "know" back then(USSR days)...the leader of the communist party and a couple of advisers,5 or 6 SMERSH agents(maybe more,up to 12),the commander of the armed forces AND the commander of the 3 armed forces branches(army,air-force and navy) and maybe a couple of scientists...

He said that most likely there were more people in the know,specially in the militray,but he could't confirm that!(him and his friends did not recognize some of the names mentioned on the book)

People have asked me about some of the illustrations of certain Alien Races on the book...this because some of them were literally copied off movies and/or video games(or not).

Me and Petro asked ourselves the same thing,as we recognized some of them...and we did contact his father in order to get an answer.

He told us that over the years the people that were adding/updating/printing the book has been using alien images from the media when they did not have a real photo or drawing from the witnesses...

So sometimes they used images from movies and video games that better discribed the Alien Races in question...this according to the witnesses testmonies(description of their encounters).

However he did say something else...something extremely interesting.

He told us that amongst high-ranking diplomats there has been much "solid" discussion and debate about "a plan" involving centain media (from online to paper to hollywood to the video game industry)and centain security departments (specially from Japen,China,Canada,USA and Europe) in order to use the "right"(to them)images to describe the appearance of aliens...

All the media involved was (in the end...either directly or because they owned the "mother" companies)owned for no more than 5 people...and that this was a concerted effort in order to get people(human-kind)used to the appearance and presence of alians...amongst us!

He(Petro's father)also told us that some of the alien races images used in video games(and other media)were used in the book PRIOR to the release of the game and/or movies...

Him and some of his friends had knowledge that some of those security departments had actually created some of the images and then "released" to the proper channels...in order for those images to be known to the general public.

This,obviously,we could not confirm...except for one of images on the book...the aliens used in the movie "Independence day" were known before the making (not even close) of the movie...by at least 8 years!

Also,some of the photos on the ARB,had been tampered with...
