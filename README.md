In 2004 I became friends with an Ukrainian guy called Petro that I met completely randomly at a bar by the beach...I was on holidays and he was there with some friends having some drinks.

Anyway,we started talking with each other...our friendship started like that...he became a regular at my house where our families would get together.

In 2008 he called me and asked me if I wanted to go on a road trip...I said "SURE!"

He had in mind to go to the south of Spain and visit his brother(his brother was there in jail at the time,near Huelva...) and also to visit his father in Portugal (his father was a former diplomat of the Ukraine, years before, and where he retired he decided to move to Portugal and live there...)

And so we went...we visited his brother and then went to Portugal to visit his father...

When we were at his house he asked us a favor(he is old)... if we could empty boxes from one of the rooms,as he wanted to make it into a bedroom for guests...

We said "OK" and went to the room,excepting to see some old newspapers...

Instead we found about 58 boxes full of old documents and books from the time when he was a diplomat...

Some papers(documents) were in Russian... some were even from the USSR times.
